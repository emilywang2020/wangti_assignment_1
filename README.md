# Assignment1

1. This program takes command line arguments for standard input and output.

2. It takes two command line arguments followed by python: 
   *i. main.py method

3. Method should be either method_1 or method_2 for the program to run.

4. If the number of command line arguments is not two, an error message will be printed and the program will be exited.

5. If the name of the method is neither method_1 or method2, an error message will be printed and the program will be exited.

6. If the conventions of the command line arguments have been followed, the program will ask for a DNA sequence from the standard input.

7. The program will then check if the sequence is a valid DNA sequence. If yes, the program will process the sequence according to the method indicated. Otherwise, an error message will be printed and the program will be exited.

8. method_1 finds the reverse complement of an input sequence without using the built-in functions.

9. method_2 finds the reverse complement of an input sequence using the maketrans() and translate() functions.

10. The final reverse complement sequence is outputed by the standard output.
